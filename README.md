Hi, I'm September. 

This repository is for personal projects. I consider myself an autodidact; currently learning some aspects of the full-stack
skillset and blockchain development. I have some experience with game development using a Unity central workflow. I'm always 
down to learn more and contribute where I can, so if you'd like to collaborate at some point, feel free to reach out to me 
through my email.

Thanks.
